# Simple Genetic Algorithm for path finding problem

I used the basic concept of GA to minimize the distance in pathfinding problems. Here are some results showing how average 
distance and minimum distance changed with each generation. I used 90% crossover and 10% mutation throughout the evolution 
process. Distance values I used in this example are between 0 to 100 and 50% nodes are connected.
